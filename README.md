# Bilingual Blood Bank Bot
This is a automated bot for blood bank, that replies with the details of blood donors when asked for blood donors. It also makes volunteers to register themselves with this bot to become a donor.
The name of the bot is # Mario

Mario works in two platforms:
1) First one is a website. The website has a chat-like interface to interact with Mario.
2) Mario can also be used in Discord, where it would be more realistic and will be in the way the bot is intended to work.

# Mario can take commands and reply in two languages - Tamil and English.
